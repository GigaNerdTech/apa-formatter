# apa-formatter
A PowerShell script that formats a research paper in APA format.

This is a PowerShell script that can take raw text input and format it in basic APA format. It has a GUI-driven interface.

Requirements:
Windows 10
PowerShell
Microsoft Word 2016 or 365

Use:
Launch the script using PowerShell. Then type the paper title, the author name, and the institution name in the first three boxes. Copy and paste the abstract text, the main body text, and the references text into each text box. Separate paragraphs with carriage return/new lines. It is strongly recommended that you edit the text in Word, Notepad++ or Notepad before entering it into the script, as it has no save functionality! Then click the Set File Path button or type the path directly into the Word Doc Save Path text box, then click Format APA! The script will generate the Word document and save it in the specified path and let you know when it is complete.

Formatting -- the script supports:
1" margins
Double spacing
Title page
First page RUNNING HEADER
Subsequent pages Title only header
Page numbers
Abstract Page
Main body section
References section
No indentations in paragraphs

Limitations:
If you need bold, italics, or other text formatting, you'll need to do it manually.
Pictures are not currently insertable into the script's text.
The references section does not format your input beyond listing it in the references section. Use APA Citation Machine to format the references automatically based on URL or input.
